# mcraft_project

A game like (but neither identical to nor a direct copy of) Minecraft (by MOJANG, go buy it) 


LIKECRAFT
by Ole Kristian Eln√¶s



Version 0.1:
* Added PerlinNoise-like algorithm to calculate terrain (top points).
* Added algorithms to cover the remaining terrain region with dirt blocks without grass (so that there are no holes in the terrain).
* Other minor changes.
* Still lots of messy and dead code in program.



Controls:
W: Forward
S: Backward
A: Left
D: Right
Q: Up
E: Down
Mouse movement: look around; set direction.



Textures:
All textures are self-made, but obiously inspired by Minecraft by Mojang.



Versions: 
0.1: Current version

First commit: 
* Purely experimental -- only goal was to get a couple of hundred blocks on screen with limited 
abstraction. 
* Most of the essential structs and usages of std::vector in this version will be thrown away.
